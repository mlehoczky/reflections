When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I'd like to keep my files in a remote repository in order to have a cloud backup of my files.
  Also, it would be helpful if i'm willing to share my code, or ask for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  In case two or more people were working on the same repository, I'd like to choose when to
  pull changes to the remote. Also, maybe I would not want to pull some commits I made in 
  the remote from other computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are clones made in the GitHub cloud.
  Clones are local copies of GitHub repositories.
  Branches are alternative developmentes of some code that can "grow" somewhat independently from other
  branches.
  I would use forks to work on some other's code to make an own version.
  I would use clones to play around with someone's code or work on my own version but only locally.
  I'd use branches to test some radically new features in my code, or maybe to make code variants.
